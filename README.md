Here we can add new goods in the inventory and the records will be stored in records.json file.
\n
  2) Inventory_Purchase:
    a) We enter the transaction or purchase details like product id,no. of items purchased,name of customer, mobile number of customer.\n
    b) If the purchased items are available in inventory, then Bill is generated.\n
    c) The detailes of the transactions are then stored in salesRecords.json file.\n
